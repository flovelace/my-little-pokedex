# My Little Pokédex

A dark mode Pokédex application built using the Pokémon (https://pokeapi.co) API. Users can either search for a specific Pokémon or generate the stats for a random Pokémon.

## About

My Little Pokédex is a small passion project. In 1999, I built a Pokémon webpage using HTML and CSS, and hosted it on GeoCities. Back then, I wished I could create a Pokédex, and with https://pokeapi.co that is now possible.

This project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Upcoming Features

- Ability to save Pokémon that have been searched
- Ability to save Pokémon that have been generated with the random button
- Ability to delete saved Pokémon
